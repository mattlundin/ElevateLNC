							<h4>MEDICAL RECORD PREPARATION</h4>
							<p>
								Navigating stacks of medical records can be daunting. We
								understand. Luckily, deciphering medical records is our
								specialty! Our healthcare professionals will comb through your
								case medical records and create a succinct yet comprehensive
								timeline and chronology report. Your “blueprint” includes
								hyperlinking resources, bookmarking, OCR and bates stamping. Our
								bread and butter is identifying the gaps, and helping you
								navigate the facts as easily as possible.

							</div>
							<h4>MERIT REVIEW</h4>
							<p>
								Save time and energy with a Merit Review. Knowing whether or not
								your case has merit, based on medical facts, is critical. A
								Merit Review by an expert healthcare professional sets the tone
								for your case strategy and execution.

							<h4>MEDICAL RESEARCH</h4>
							<p>
								Does your case need a little boost? A strong case relies on
								strong evidence. Let the nurse experts at ELNC support your case
								through evidence based research. We will do the digging and
								ensure your case strategy is supported with credible evidence.

							<h4>MEDICAL RECORD AUDIT</h4>
							<p>
								Identifying discrepancies within the medical chart is critical
								to your case. Whether you are a plaintiff or defendant attorney,
								understanding the patient's medical record allows for optimal
								client representation. Let the experts at ELNC perform an audit
								on your medical records with a keen clinical eye. Whether
								electronic or paper chart, maximize your representation with a
								professional medical record analysis, and review.

							<h4>BILLING SUMMARIES</h4>
							<p>
								It’s not a secret that healthcare has its own language. Jump
								into the throes of billing and coding, now you're in another
								sublanguage with changing dialects. (Looking at you, ICD codes!)
								ELNC will take the voyage through the medical records, extract
								the billing summary and create a succinct resource that is easy
								to navigate and decipher what remains. The billing summary links
								with the chronology report, where you have additional support
								via hyperlinking, bates stamping and a blueprint of what is in
								your records.

								ELNC will pair you with the best medical expert witness or nurse
								subject matter expert to support your case.
