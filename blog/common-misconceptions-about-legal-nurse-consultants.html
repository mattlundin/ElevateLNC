							>A nurse's skill set can transfer and translate into almost any
							profession. The law and medical space are a common intersection
							where nurses contribute their skills and expertise. As you may
							already know, there is a dedicated specialty and group of nurses
							working alongside attorneys as Legal Nurse Consultants (LNC).
							Since the 1980's legal nurse consultants have been working
							alongside attorneys and legal professionals, guiding their
							medically focused cases. Sometimes, the lines and limitations of
							the Legal Nurse Consultant's role blur. This article explores some
							of the misconceptions about the LNC role.</em

					<h2 class="blog-heading">Legal Nurse Consultant vs. Paralegal</h2>
					<p>
						Paralegals and Legal Nurse Consultants (LNC) are two critical team
						members in any medicolegal case. (Dare we say partners in crime?)
						Although the two are important stakeholders on medically focused
						cases, and some responsibilities overlap, it is important to
						understand the difference in their roles.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						The LNC is a Registered Nurse who uses their nursing and healthcare
						expertise to assist the attorney and legal professionals in
						educating their team about medical events in their cases.
						<a
							href="https://elevatelnc.com/blogs/what-is-a-legal-nurse-consultant"
							target="_blank"
							>The LNC's responsibilities</a
						>
						include analyzing medical records, interpreting medical language,
						conducting research, and helping attorneys prepare for depositions.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Paralegals are legal professionals who work under the supervision of
						an attorney. Most paralegals have a degree or professional
						certificate in paralegal studies from an accredited program approved
						by the
						<a
							href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/paralegals/paralegal-resource-directory/"
							target="_blank"
							>American Bar Association.</a
						>
						The paralegal's responsibilities include conducting legal research,
						drafting legal documents, and assisting with discovery and
						pleadings.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						As an LNC, it is important to have a working relationship with the
						paralegals within the firm or team you are working with. It is also
						important for the paralegal to understand the Legal Nurse
						Consultant's role.
					</p>
					<h2 class="blog-heading">
						Legal Nurse Consultant vs. Subject Matter Expert (SME)
					</h2>
					<p>
						According to the
						<a
							href="https://www.opm.gov/faqs/qa.aspx?fid=a6da6c2e-e1cb-4841-b72d-53eb4adf1ab1&pid=c9d6d33b-a98c-45f5-ad76-497565d58bcf"
							target="_blank"
							>US Office of Personnel Management (OPM)</a
						>
						a subject matter expert, or SME, is a "person with bona fide expert
						knowledge about what it takes to do a particular job."
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						In essence, a Legal Nurse Consultant is an SME in healthcare
						matters, and even more so within the specialty they practice.
						However, when it comes to being a member of a team working on a
						medical case, the LNC role and SME role can stand on their own.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Establishing role expectations will be critical when reviewing the
						needs of the medicolegal case. A Legal Nurse Consultant can
						participate as a Subject Matter Expert, or the LNC can interview and
						recruit SMEs on behalf of the attorney-client.
					</p>
					<h2 class="blog-heading">
						Legal Nurse Consultant vs. Expert Witness
					</h2>
					<p>
						Per the
						<a
							href="https://academyofexperts.org/users-of-experts/what-is-an-expert-witness/"
							target="_blank"
							>Academy of Experts</a
						>, an expert witness is an individual with knowledge or experience
						within a discipline beyond that of a layperson. An expert witness's
						duty and primary function are to provide an impartial, expert
						opinion on particulars of a case based on the information provided.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						You are correct in your assessment if you’re mentally ticking off
						boxes where the LNC overlaps with this definition. A Legal Nurse
						Consultant meets the criteria and can testify as an expert witness
						for a case. The LNC can also research, interview, and prepare an
						expert witness to best support the medical case. The LNC’s expertise
						is up-leveled, where they can analyze the case at hand and identify
						where an expert witness would benefit the plaintiff or defense
						attorney.
					</p>
					<h2 class="blog-heading">Elevate Legal Nurse Consulting</h2>
					<p>
						At ELNC, we are Legal Nurse Consultants specializing in medical
						record preparation, audit, merit review, medical research, and

						testimony and SME services. We can also research and interview
						clinicians as SMEs, or expert witnesses to ensure you have the right
						healthcare expert to support your case.
