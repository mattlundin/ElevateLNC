					<p>Three Reasons to Avoid Using Abbreviations</p>
					<p>
						Listen, we get it. As a clinician, you are short on time and at
						times even shorter on resources. You understand the importance of
						accurate documentation (link to other blog post) on patient care and
						still want to make sure you're providing care not just writing about
						it. The appeal to abbreviate is understandable, but not advised.
						What may seem like a shortcut in the interim, is not a great
						practice for the long term.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Let’s review three of the reasons a clinician should avoid using
						abbreviations in their documentation.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						1. <strong>Abbreviations can create mystery.</strong> When a
						provider has to decode an acronym, that can take time away from
						patient care. Mystery can create a lapse in care, which can have
						devastating effects on the patient. Sometimes what may make sense to
						you at the moment may not translate to another provider. For
						example, you are a nurse caring for a patient, and the provider
						writes, “Patient may ambulate AFAT.” Would you understand what that
						meant? How much time would it take to figure out the acronym? The
						provider is unavailable via phone, so you enlist the help of another
						nurse. Now, two nurses are consumed trying to figure out an order
						and distracting from patient care. (Ps: it means as far as
						tolerated, and no, it is not an approved acronym)
					</p>
					<br />
					<br />
					<p>
						2.
						<strong>Abbreviations can be misinterpreted.</strong> Abbreviations
						are not detrimental, but the consequences could be deadly when used
						incorrectly or misunderstood. One abbreviation could signify up to
						four different medical terms. For example, MS can indicate morphine
						sulfate, multiple sclerosis, mental status, or mitral stenosis. How
						can the reader understand what is intended by two standalone
						letters? It is safer to spell out the word or words rather than risk
						an unintended interpretation.
					</p>
					<br />
					<br />
					<p>
						3. <strong>“Abbreviations can cause legal nightmares.” </strong> As
						<span class="underline">Nursing Services Organization (NSO),</span>
						a leader in providing Nursing insurance services and education, so
						aptly put it, abbreviations can be a legal nightmare. Anytime you
						document on a patient chart, it is considered evergreen – meaning it
						should be understood in the moment as well as in the future. It may
						be tempting to get creative and save some time in the moment, but
						deviation from an approved list can have legal implications. Can you
						prove what you intended to document with an abbreviation 5 years
						prior if called to testify? Can you conclusively defend your
						intention?
					</p>
					<br />
					<br />

					<p>
						At Elevate Legal Nurse Consulting (ELNC) we are healthcare
						professionals who provide medicolegal services to law professionals.
						As healthcare professionals, we understand the temptation to use
						abbreviations when documenting patient care. Time is a critical
						resource after all. Protect your patients, and your license, by
						using proper documentation best practices.
					</p>
					<br />
					<br />
					<p>
						A common service we provide to our attorney clients across the US is
						a thorough medical chart review. Often we find abbreviations
						documented that cannot stand alone and may implicate a deviation
						from the standard of care. If you are interested in a medical case
