							malpractice attorneys utilize the services of an LNC through the
							lifecycle of their malpractice cases. Below are three reasons you
							need to partner with an LNC on your next malpractice case.</em

					</p>
					<h2 class="blog-heading">Invaluable Expertise</h2>
					<p>
						A Legal Nurse Consultant is an expert in the healthcare field. They
						are Registered Nurses who can translate the nuanced medical jargon
						into layman's terms. The LNC can evaluate the integrity of medical
						records and analyze the documents for validity, saving the attorney
						and the team time and averting headaches. The Legal Nurse
						Consultant's report can provide organized evidence and arguments to
						speed document preparation and facilitate faster settlements.
					</p>
					<h2 class="blog-heading">Cost-Effective</h2>
					<p>
						The LNC can save a malpractice firm time and money through their
						services. Merit reviews, EMR (medical record) analysis, and medical
						chart evaluation are a few critical services any plaintiff or
						defense attorney can benefit from. The Legal Nurse Consultant can
						analyze and evaluate a medical record to determine completion and
						validity, which is crucial during case preparation. The LNC can then
						take the record, organize it, and translate it into a presentation
						the attorney or legal professional can utilize.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Complicated cases may require research, a skill where the LNC is
						efficient and effective. Save time droning through files and
						research with an LNC. They can effectively navigate best practice
						standards and evidence to collate case support.
					</p>
					<h2 class="blog-heading">Vital Resource</h2>
					<p>
						LNCs are well versed in knowing, understanding, and communicating
						the standard of care. When partnering with a Legal Nurse Consultant,
						they can walk through whether the case adheres to or upholds the
						standard of care and again determine the validity of a case.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						The Legal Nurse Consultant can help secure a medical expert for your
						case. (Yes, you may need to invoke a healthcare professional other
						than a doctor for your case, and the LNC can help determine the best
						support for the case at hand. The LNC themself can also serve as
						expert witnesses for your case. Nurses are experts at breaking down
						complex topics into digestible understood concepts. The LNC would be
						a great asset to the expert witness panel, especially if the jury
						requires additional support in understanding complex topics to
						render a decision.
					</p>
					<h2 class="blog-heading">Bonus – Merit Reviews</h2>
					<p>
						Okay, so merit reviews technically are not a bonus considering we
						discussed this LNC service, but to harness the value of a Merit
						Review performed by an LNC bears repeating. A thorough merit review
						serves both plaintiffs and defense attorneys. The Legal Nurse
						Consultant merit review is the gateway to determining if a case is
						worth retaining and investing in.
