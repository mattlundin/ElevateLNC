							>The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations
							("The Joint Commission" or JCAHO) defines a Sentinel Event as an
							unexpected occurrence involving death or serious physical or
							psychological injury. In January 2021, JACHO amended the
							definition of falls to assist healthcare institutions in aligning
							policies and determining if a fall is reportable as a sentinel
							event. This article will review the policy addendum and how
							collaborating with a legal nurse consultant will elevate your fall
							case.</em

					<h2 class="blog-heading">What is a Sentinel Event?</h2>
					<p>
						If you are just joining in on our Sentinel Series, you may be
						wondering what exactly is a Sentinel Event?
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						A Sentinel Event is a patient safety event not primarily related to
						the natural course of the patient's illness or underlying condition
						that results in death, permanent harm, severe harm, temporary harm
						and/or requires intervention to sustain life.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Each year the Joint Commission publishes a report on the most
						reported sentinel events of the previous year. January 1, 2021,
						JACHO's Sentinel Summary Report and Policy was amended to define
						fall events further. The revision allows for scrutiny into whether a
						fall is considered a reportable event or not.
					</p>
					<h2 class="blog-heading">
						Patient Falls - Most Reported Sentinel Event
					</h2>
					<p>
						Patient falls resulting in injury consistently are among the most
						frequently reviewed Sentinel Events by The Joint Commission. In
						2021, patient falls remained the most frequently reported Sentinel
						Event.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						The Sentinel Event Policy's new definition aligns with guidelines
						from the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators™ (NDNQI).
						The revision helps staff in all healthcare settings understand
						whether a fall should be reviewed as a Sentinel Event. In addition,
						this revision and definition inclusion will help further expand the
						knowledge around falls and increase the effectiveness of
						implementing fall preventive measures. The
						<a
							href="https://www.jointcommission.org/resources/patient-safety-topics/sentinel-event/sentinel-event-policy-and-procedures/"
							>policy</a
						>
						defines a fall as a reportable Sentinel Event as:
					</p>
					<br />
					<br />
					<p class="indent">
						“[a] fall resulting in any of the following: any fracture; surgery,
						casting, or traction; required consult/management or comfort care
						for a neurological (e.g., skull fracture, subdural or intracranial
						hemorrhage) or internal (e.g., rib fracture, small liver laceration)
						injury; a patient with coagulopathy who receives blood products as a
						result of the fall; or death or permanent harm as a result of
						injuries sustained from the fall (not from physiologic events
						causing the fall)”
					</p>
					<h2 class="blog-heading">
						Legal Nurse Consultant Role In a Falls Case
					</h2>
					<p>
						A Legal Nurse Consultant (LNC), as we have covered
						<a
							href="https://elevatelnc.com/blog/what-is-a-legal-nurse-consultant.html"
							>before</a
						>, is an individual with specialized, real-world medical experience
						as a Registered Nurse combined with an understanding of the legal
						implications of a case.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						In a case involving a fall, the Legal Nurse Consultant combs the
						plaintiff's records and creates a chronology from before and after
						the fall, including a Sentinel Event report, if appropriate. The
						purpose of the review of prior medical care is to determine the
						baseline or condition of the patient before the fall. Some key facts
						the LNC will look for include:
					</p>
					<br />
					<ul class="indent">
						<li>Was the patient prone to falls?</li>
						<br />
						<li>Had the patient had a prior fall causing injury?</li>
						<br />
						<li>What were the risk factors that contributed to the fall?</li>
						<br />
						<li>Are there any pertinent medical records that are missing?</li>
					</ul>
					<br />
					<p>
						The attorney can use a chronology to fully understand the patient's
						pre-existing conditions, injuries, and consequences surrounding the
						case.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						The LNC can also perform medical literature research to see how
						current literature and practice standard supports or refutes the
						causation claim. Medical expert recruitment and preparation, medical
						record summaries, and testimony as experts are some other ways a
						Legal Nurse Consultant can assist with a falls case.
