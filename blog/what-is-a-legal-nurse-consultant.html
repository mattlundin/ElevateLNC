						Since the 1980s, Legal Nurse Consultants have been collaborative
						strategists, supporting their legal partners and clients in
						navigating healthcare-related cases. Once in a while the big
						question pops up: what are Legal Nurse Consultants?
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Who are these interpreters navigating the legal and medical worlds?
						This article will break down those questions and give the Legal
						Nurse Consultant Role a little more color.
					</p>
					<h2 class="blog-heading">What is Legal Nurse Consulting?</h2>
					<p>
						Before diving into <em>who</em> a legal nurse consultant is, let’s
						take a step back and understand <em>what</em> Legal Nurse Consulting
						is about. At its core, Legal Nurse Consulting is the analysis and
						evaluation of facts, and the rendering of informed expert opinions
						related to the delivery of healthcare services and outcomes.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						The main role of a Legal Nurse Consultant (LNC) is to help law
						professionals understand and process medicolegal information. The
						LNC works to help bridge the infamous gap between medicine and the
						law. The upswing of an LNC is that they are experts in practical
						medicine, and have a firm grasp on the legal aspects of the
						healthcare industry.
					</p>
					<h2 class="blog-heading">
						What (or who) is a Legal Nurse Consultant?
					</h2>
					<p class="bold">
						<a
							href="http://www.aalnc.org/page/what-is-an-an-lnc"
							target="_blank"
							><span
								>The American Association of Legal Nurse Consultants summarizes
								it best:
							</span></a
						>“A Legal Nurse Consultant (LNC) is a licensed registered nurse who
						performs a critical analysis of clinically related issues in various
						settings, in the legal arena.”
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						As a medical insider, who knows the inner workings of the
						complicated healthcare system, the LNC can assist attorneys and law
						professionals as they navigate their medically focused cases.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						The LNC uses their experience in healthcare to help attorney clients
						understand various regulations, protocols, and practice standards so
						the attorney and their team will have a better understanding of
						healthcare obligations in scenarios related to their case.
					</p>
					<h2 class="blog-heading">What does a Legal Nurse Consultant Do?</h2>
					<p>
						The specifics of a Legal Nurse Consultant’s duties will vary based
						on the case they are consulting on, the needs of the attorney
						client, or an LNC’s niche (aka practice specialty). Although
						offerings vary, the services of an LNC include, but are not limited
						to:
					</p>
					<br />
					<ul class="blog-ul">
						<li>Taking part in client interviews</li>
						<li>Analyze medical records (paper and EMR)</li>
						<li>Conduct research</li>
						<li>Define standards of care in medical malpractice cases</li>
						<li>Evaluate strengths and weaknesses of cases</li>
						<li>Write or interpret medical language in legal documents</li>
						<li>Educate lawyers and clients about medical affairs</li>
						<li>
							Determine plaintiffs’ future medical needs and costs for care
						</li>
						<li>Participate in medical exams</li>
						<li>Testify as an expert or Subject Matter Expert (SME)</li>
						<li>Help attorneys prepare for depositions and trials</li>
					</ul>
					<br />
					<p>
						Developing a partnership with a trusted LNC allows the attorney
						and/or legal team to have guidance and an overall understanding of
						the healthcare components of their case.
